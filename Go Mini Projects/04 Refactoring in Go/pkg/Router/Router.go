Understand ROUTING.
- Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic in a network or between or across multiple networks.

ROUTING in web development.
Routing or router in web development is a mechanism
where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them.
To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page.

/* REFERENCES

By default, when you create or run a container using docker create or docker run, it does not publish any of its ports to the outside world. To make a port available to services outside of Docker, or to Docker containers which are not connected to the containerâ€™s network, use the --publish or -p flag. This creates a firewall rule which maps a container port to a port on the Docker host to the outside world. Here are some examples.
